# Calcium Imaging Analysis in Python
  - **When**: April 9th-11th, 2025 @ 9:30 - 17:00 CET
  - **Format**: Hands-On Workshop (>50% Small-Group Exercises)
  - **Length**: 18 Hours
  - **Location**: Online (Zoom link will be provided upon registration)
  - **Registration**: TBA


How do I extract calcium traces from images, and how do I analyze them? In this workshop, we cover the essential concepts needed to answer these questions using Python tools like NumPy, SciPy, and Napari. We will explore how to convert continuous calcium traces into neural spikes through deconvolution, extract fluorescence estimates both manually and automatically, and improve these estimates by removing contributions from the surrounding neuropil. Participants will work with real calcium imaging data to apply the above tools and methods.  

## Topics
  - Extracting flourescence estimates from image or image stack and converting them to neural spikes. 
  - Manual and automated selection of Region(s) of Interest 
  - Processing calcium image stacks with suite2p.
