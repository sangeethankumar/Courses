    "# **Multi-Pixel Data Extraction to 1D Calcium Trace**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit, we focus on a common task in calcium imaging: converting multi-pixel fluorescence data from a single neuron into a single 1D trace over time. While each image frame may contain dozens or hundreds of pixels representing a cell, our goal is to summarize this data into a trace that reflects the neuron’s activity. This is a foundational step in calcium imaging analysis, and sets the stage for event detection, deconvolution, and time-series modeling. The sections below walk through each step—starting from pixel selection and ending with signal aggregation using both simple and robust methods."

    "## **Section 1: Identifying Active Pixels Using Thresholding**  \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a meaningful 1D trace from an image, the first step is to determine which pixels represent the cell’s signal. This involves thresholding fluorescence values to distinguish cell-related activity from background noise. Even in a single-cell image, signal intensity may vary due to inhomogeneous dye uptake, photobleaching, or imaging artifacts. Thresholding helps isolate the most relevant parts of the cell, so that downstream analysis is based on pixels that contribute meaningful information. This section introduces both global and adaptive thresholding techniques, and includes ways to visualize and validate the selected pixels.\n",

    "## **Section 2: Extracting Pixel Time Series Using Fancy Indexing**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the relevant pixels have been identified, the next step is to extract their fluorescence values across all time frames. Since cells often have irregular shapes, their pixels are not arranged in a rectangular block. This requires the use of advanced indexing techniques to selectively access those pixel values. In this section, we demonstrate how to use `numpy`'s fancy indexing to extract pixel-wise time series from a 3D calcium imaging dataset. The result is a 2D matrix where each row corresponds to a pixel and each column to a time point—an essential structure for averaging.\n",

    "With the pixel-wise fluorescence time series in hand, we now reduce this information to a single trace that summarizes the cell's activity. This is commonly done by averaging the fluorescence across all pixels in the ROI at each time point.

The goal is to obtain a 1D time series that is representative, interpretable, and suitable for downstream analyses.\n",

    "While averaging is often sufficient, not all pixels in the ROI may contribute equally to the signal. Some may be on the edge, poorly illuminated, or contain more noise. Weighted and non-parametric aggregation methods can improve the quality of the final trace by accounting for pixel-level differences. In this section, we introduce weighted averaging using `numpy`, and robust methods such as the median or trimmed mean using `scipy.stats`. These techniques help produce cleaner and more biologically realistic traces, particularly in cases with signal heterogeneity.\n",
