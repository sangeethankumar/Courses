    "# **dF/F₀ Normalization: Using the Neuropil to Get Better Cell Fluorescence Estimates**\n",
    "\n",
    "Calcium imaging provides a window into the activity of neurons, but raw fluorescence signals are often influenced by baseline fluctuations and background activity from the surrounding tissue. To make these signals interpretable, researchers compute dF/F₀, which represents the fractional change in fluorescence relative to a resting baseline. This transformation highlights calcium transients while minimizing slow drift and background noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you will walk through the core steps for computing dF/F₀ from a single-cell calcium imaging dataset. The workflow includes subtracting the neuropil contribution, estimating a stable baseline (F₀), and using spatial masks to define the cell and its surrounding region. All steps are implemented using just three Python libraries: numpy, scikit-image, and matplotlib."

    "\n",
    "This section focuses on the main transformation used in calcium imaging: computing the relative change in fluorescence, or dF/F₀. The goal is to produce a signal that represents meaningful activity changes, while removing contamination from surrounding neuropil tissue. You will start with raw fluorescence traces from the soma and its surrounding neuropil, then subtract a scaled neuropil signal before normalizing the result using a baseline F₀. These operations are implemented with numpy, allowing for clean and efficient processing of time-series data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before calculating dF/F₀, it is necessary to estimate the cell’s baseline fluorescence, referred to as F₀. This value should reflect the resting fluorescence level of the cell in the absence of activity. A poor F₀ estimate can either inflate or suppress neural transients, making activity harder to detect. In this section, you will explore methods for calculating a stable and adaptive baseline using moving averages and percentile-based filters. These methods are designed to track slow shifts in baseline while remaining robust to fast activity events.\n",
