    "# **dF/F₀ Normalization: Using the Neuropil to Get Better Cell Fluorescence Estimates**\n",
    "\n",
    "Calcium imaging data often includes background signals from the surrounding neuropil, which can contaminate the true fluorescence of the cell. In this module, we will walk through a practical workflow for performing dF/F₀ normalization that improves signal accuracy by subtracting the neuropil signal. Even in experiments with only a single-cell field of view, accounting for neuropil contribution can significantly enhance the interpretation of activity traces.\n",

    "We will use Python tools such as `numpy`, `scikit-image`, and `matplotlib` to implement each step."

    "\n",
    "In this section, you will compute the dF/F₀ fluorescence signal by first subtracting a scaled version of the neuropil signal from the raw cell trace. Then, you will normalize the corrected signal using a baseline fluorescence value (F₀) that has been estimated or provided in advance. This step is critical for separating the true cellular signal from surrounding activity and for comparing fluorescence changes over time. We will use NumPy for vectorized operations that make these calculations both efficient and reproducible.\n",
