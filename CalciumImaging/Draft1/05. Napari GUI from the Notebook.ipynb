    "# **Napari GUI from the Notebook: Labeling Images**\n",
    "\n",
    "This session explores how to use the Napari image viewer directly from a Jupyter notebook for manual annotation of calcium imaging data. You will learn to load imaging datasets, visualize them frame-by-frame, draw and manage regions of interest (ROIs), and organize those labels in a way that prepares the data for downstream analysis. The goal is to build a clean, intuitive, and reproducible manual labeling pipeline for multi-cell calcium imaging."

    "\n",
    "Napari allows users to interactively draw regions of interest (ROIs) over cells in calcium imaging data. In this section, you will learn how to navigate the imaging dataset inside Napari and manually mark neurons using either shapes or label tools. Manual ROI labeling is often the first step in analyzing calcium signals from raw movies, and it ensures that the cell outlines used for analysis have been visually verified and curated by a human observer.\n",
