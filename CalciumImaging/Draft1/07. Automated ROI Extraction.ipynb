    "## Automated ROI Detection  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This module introduces a structured approach for identifying neurons automatically in calcium imaging datasets. Manual annotation is useful for small-scale analysis, but for large experiments, automated Region of Interest (ROI) detection is essential. The process will be divided into four stages — enhancing the image, detecting candidates, refining masks, and evaluating results — to help you build a robust and scalable segmentation pipeline."

    "  \n",
    "Raw calcium imaging data often contains noise that can obscure the structure of neurons. Before beginning the detection process, it is important to enhance the image so that relevant features are easier to identify. In this section, you will generate projection images from the full movie and apply Gaussian filtering to reduce high-frequency noise. This will help reveal neuron shapes more clearly and improve the reliability of later detection steps.\n",

In this section, you will use peak detection methods to locate local intensity maxima and apply simple filters based on intensity and spacing. These points serve as initial estimates of where neurons might be located, which will be further refined in the next step.\n",
