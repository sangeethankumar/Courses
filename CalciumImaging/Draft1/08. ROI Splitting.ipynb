    "**Overarching Goal**:  \n",
    "This module introduces the process of subdividing ROIs that may encompass more than one neuron. As imaging resolution and signal complexity increase, it becomes more common for automated methods to group nearby neurons into a single ROI. In this module, you will learn how to recognize these cases, enhance local structure, and split such ROIs into distinct neuronal units â€” all while maintaining accuracy and interpretability."

    "\n",
    "Some ROIs are unusually large, irregular in shape, or contain multiple peaks in intensity â€” features that may suggest the presence of more than one neuron. This section focuses on how to systematically identify these cases. You will learn to compute and interpret properties like compactness, peak count, and eccentricity, enabling more informed decisions about whether a region needs to be split.\n",
