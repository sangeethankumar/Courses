## Desktop Client/Mobile App

[Download links available here](https://hochschulcloud.nrw/en/download/index.html)

The desktop client is a program that saves your cloud files on your computer or laptop. It runs in the background and automatically updates your files, so you always have the latest version on all your devices.

The mobile app is great for viewing and sharing files anywhere. You can upload, delete, and move files like photos. Since phones and tablets have less storage, files are not downloaded automatically. They are only saved to your device when you open them.
