# Calcium Imaging Analysis in Python
  - **When**: April 7th-11th, 2025 @ 9:30 - 17:00 CET
  - **Format**: Hands-On Workshop (>50% Small-Group Exercises)
  - **Length**: 18 Hours
  - **Location**: Online (Zoom link will be provided upon registration)
  - **Registration**: TBA

How can we extract meaningful insights from calcium imaging data? In this hands-on workshop, students gain the skills needed to record and analyze calcium imaging data. Students will learn how to acquire raw experimental data using Bonsai-rx, a visual programming language to acquire data. Then, they learn common pre-processing to transform raw calcium imaging data into dF/F signals, whether they used fiber photometry, 1-photon (1p), or 2-photon (2p) imaging. They will also explore how to analyze processed data to understand neural activity and behavioral patterns`. 

## Topics
  - Acquiring raw data from setup: introduction to bonsai-rx 
  - Calcium Imaging Data Processing: Pre-processing techniques for calcium imaging data obtained from fiber photometry, 1-photon, or 2-photon setup to get dF/F signals. 
  - Calcium Imaging Data Analysis: Event detection, activity mapping, and other analyses.
